a list view that shows all the records in the system (e.g., a list of document)
a detail view that shows a single record in detail (e.g., the content of a document)
an edit view that allows to change a record (e.g., changing the text of a document)
a create view that allows adding a record to the system (e.g., adding new documents to the list)
a delete operation accessible from list and detail views (e.g., deleting documents from the list)
the data comes from your database
there is some form of user account to protect the editing of the data (create, update, delete)
It will continue and extend work from Terrorist Detection 1, creating new pages and designs as
needed.
Third-party front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation, as well as other JS
libraries, are generally allowed for this project.
